The aim of the protocol is to carry a parachain's block from authoring to inclusion through a process that can be carried out repeatedly and in parallel for each parachain connected to the relay chain.

## Main Actors

### Validators

They are responsible for validating proposed parachain's blocks by checking the Proof-of-Validity (PoV) of the blocks and ensuring the PoV remains available. They have "skin in the game", meaning they have funds bonded on-chain that can be partially or fully confiscated in case of misbehavior.

### Collators

They create the PoV that validators know how to check. Creating PoV requires familiarity with transaction format and block authoring rules of a specific parachain, as well as having access to its full state.

### Fishermen

They catch misbehaving validators in exchange for a bounty. Collators and Validators can behave as fishermen.
